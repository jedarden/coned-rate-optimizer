# Test Suite

This directory contains automated tests and fixtures for the ConEd Rate Optimizer calc.js core.

## Files

- `test/test.js` — Automated test suite for calc.js core functionality
- `test/fixtures/sample-greenbutton.csv` — Sample Green Button CSV data for testing

## Running Tests

### Run automated test suite
```bash
node test/test.js
```

### Run verification script with test fixture
```bash
node verify.js
# Or explicitly:
node verify.js test/fixtures/sample-greenbutton.csv
```

### Run verification with your own data
```bash
node verify.js /path/to/your/green-button-export.csv
```

## Test Coverage

The automated test suite covers:

1. **CSV Parsing** — Green Button CSV format parsing
2. **Data Analysis** — Usage analysis and rate calculations
3. **Rate Calculations** — Standard vs TOU rate accuracy
4. **Edge Cases** — Error handling for malformed/empty input
5. **Rate Override** — applyRates() functionality

## Fixture Data

The `sample-greenbutton.csv` fixture contains 3 days of hourly interval data (72 readings) representing:
- Summer usage (June) with peak-heavy load shape
- Winter usage (December) with higher heating loads
- Total ~48 kWh across the test period

This fixture provides a minimal but realistic dataset that exercises all core calculation paths while keeping the test suite fast.

## Expected Results

Using the test fixture:
- **Standard rate**: ~$48.86 (annualized ~$5,945)
- **TOU rate**: ~$63.00 (annualized ~$7,665)
- **Verdict**: "Stay on Standard" (peak-heavy usage makes TOU more expensive)

Your real data will vary — the tool is designed to give honest recommendations even when switching plans would cost more.
